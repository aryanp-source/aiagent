3. **Choose Your Integration Method**
   - Follow one of the integration options below based on your preferred MCP client

4. **Ask Your AI Assistant to Interact with Notion**
   - "Create a new page with today's tasks"
   - "Update my meeting notes in Notion"
   - "Add bullet points to my meeting notes page"

### Cursor Integration

#### Method 1: Using mcp.json

1. Create or edit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion-mcp-server": {
      "command": "env NOTION_TOKEN=YOUR_KEY NOTION_PAGE_ID=YOUR_PAGE_ID npx",
      "args": ["-y", "notion-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Replace `YOUR_KEY` and `YOUR_PAGE_ID` with your actual Notion API key and page ID
3. Restart Cursor to apply the changes

#### Method 2: Manual Mode

1. Open Cursor and go to Settings
2. Navigate to the "MCP" or "Model Context Protocol" section
3. Click "Add Server" or equivalent
4. Enter the following command in the appropriate field:

```
env NOTION_TOKEN=YOUR_KEY NOTION_PAGE_ID=YOUR_PAGE_ID npx -y notion-mcp-server
```

5. Replace `YOUR_KEY` and `YOUR_PAGE_ID` with your actual Notion API key and page ID
6. Save the settings and restart Cursor if necessary

### Claude Desktop Integration

1. Create or edit the `mcp.json` file in your configuration directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_TOKEN": "YOUR_KEY",
        "NOTION_PAGE_ID": "YOUR_PAGE_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Replace `YOUR_KEY` and `YOUR_PAGE_ID` with your actual Notion API key and page ID
3. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes

## üîß Technical Details

- Built using TypeScript and the MCP SDK (version 1.7.0+)
- Uses the official Notion API client (@notionhq/client v2.3.0+)
- Follows the Model Context Protocol specification
- Implements tools for CRUD operations on Notion pages and blocks
- Supports efficient batch operations for performance optimization
- Validates input/output with Zod schemas

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**
  - **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your Notion token has the correct permissions and integration is enabled for your pages/databases
  - **Page Access Issues**: Make sure your integration has been added to the pages you're attempting to access
  - **Rate Limiting**: Notion API has rate limits - use batch operations to optimize requests
